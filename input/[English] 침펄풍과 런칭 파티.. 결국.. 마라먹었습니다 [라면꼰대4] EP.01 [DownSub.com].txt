[Music] It's

like a plate after a party

[Music]

Yes [

Music]

How are you?  Let's



















go to season 4 mummy with the feeling of sharing the





legacy.

You can come out





now.



Why were you waiting for someone else's,

so it's really fun So this is a

real documentary, but it's

coming out so late It's too late now

[Music] I

really think negative things will

flow I

don't like myself either

so I purposely forgot everything

[Music]

But why is Fortune I need

to know this today  That's right, this is just a kind of rage in the scenery. It's crazy.







I've been watching it for years. I need to know.



Season 4. Oh, it's



really Fortune.  Aren't you glad

Sappsaladis

What are you talking about

[Music] It's



sealed this time Ah, what, I sealed it for a second. If

we put it in the urn like this and

don't come out later, we and

everyone here should buy it.

What is 1086?





It's the third largest here like a guru who catches yogi.

Ah yes, in Gyeonggi-do.



[Music]



My hair is simply so annoying. If I wore leather today, it would be a big deal, but it's

leather and it's

a clone. Well, it's

a little different from the previous season.



] Can you

do that?



You seem very perplexed, but what the hell is in you?

These are my thoughts. My

head is simply too annoying. A

45-year-old man and this

launch party.

Launch party. I wanted to have a party like that.

What kind of

party is it?  You do the same thing.

Snacks are just like that. Yeah, right.

I love snacks, gimbap, chicken, and





kimchi.  There's









Daiso, and you're surprised. You

made it that way because of Daiso. Does

that make sense?

[Music] [

Laughs] It's

quiet and nice.  Shall we hit and go? I













did some airborne troops and didn't

try archer. That's the taste.  It was ready-to-













eat. That

octopus skewer, I chose all of them.



How about grilled scallops





with butter? I have something to do, so







I have something to do.  Yeah Oh, but I

really feel close to the neighborhood here. It's

a littlebit

Kimchi Department's jackpot. I wrote it wrongly. It's Kimchi

and the doctor's office, but the

kindergarten is also

annoying. Please change the typo with a laugh.









]

Or what do you do? It's a





joke I did







it, but why don't you do this?  I















saw this on subway line 1,

at the back

[laughter] It's



not a regular menu,

auntie, there are three corporals and a lot of sick people

[Music] There is



this person.  It's







violent, but

really, no,

I want to do a house prostitute on my clothes. Shall we do it behind the scenes?

Then let's do the three of us together.









So don't be ashamed of each other

Don't recommend to anyone what hyung can't do



Hey I

said it I know I did it I'll give it to you Wearing it







once is really

cool





[Music] Hey, the

last years look really good.

Let's see that earlier. Wait a minute. It's a



mercenary from Korea.

Mercenary

Here in Korea,

how come?  [





Music]

Please be gentle

[Music]

Gimpo Joo Ho-min Lee Byung-geon And on top of this,

choose a mask that symbolizes you,

attach it to the hatch,

get this one on top, and put your name on the bottom



[Music] I

like it and pile it up.

In the past, I almost

became really weak.  Let's not have a party,

this is a party, it'll

come when we're young

[Music]

Okay okay

black I'm

not even wearing a jumpsuit but I've become a ska Jean It's

worth 500,000 won, right now

[Laugh] It's

already cool,

it's okay Hey, I

got the answer to the real sebo

Oh, but the name  It would have been really nice if it wasn't there. I would have been



surprised by this outfit. Even if a soldier like this greets the

fashion industry

like this

[Laugh]

[Music] You're

good at it,

Pocheon Jidida.







Shall we move to a real party?



[Laughs] There

is also a pool. The pool

looks like dried peppers. I wish it

came a month later.  It's









like a wedding hall here. It's

not an outdoor ceremony, but what we usually

think of

[Music] It's a

real party

[Music]



Hey, but I can't stand it when I see the grass.







Corrosion

[Music]

That's a very dangerous disease

[Music]

What, what, uh, the

machine comes out

[Music] Hey, you





couldn't stand it after season 2.

Yeah, how do you suppress that instinct?  If you were









desperate, shouldn't you

accept it?



















] It's

specialized. These are all themed, so I'll









try decaf. [Music

] There are













cigarettes.

Oh,

but it's for home use, so it's for business use. It's

good because it's for home use. It's

good. I loaded it up and it's













quiet.





[Music] It's

delicious

Coffee is bound to be

popular. During the

launching party,

the two of them





were ramen ambassadors right?



What is it?

[Music] Being

extremely salty is

the same as being



extremely sympathetic.









I can't tell them apart.

Wait a minute, I think

this flower took root because it was originally alive.



[Music]

[Laughter] I

think it took root knowing that the flower was black. I like it. Now,







please.  Yes,





there is an update on the ambassador perks.

I really like that. I



really like other premiums about men. I'm really looking forward to

















it.  [Music]

My







toothbrush came to visit more hotels in Asia [Music] Hyung, when I go to a hotel, I bring one by



one Amenity I've

been looking for while going around. Today [Music] I





have a hair tie [

Music]

Tell me, tell me

[Music]

Ambassador means

ambassador  I have a

mission as well. It seems to be

various media, but every

time it comes out, every media comes out

[Laugh]

[Music]



How will Season 4 go in a different direction from the previous one?





He and my brother like the atmosphere of the Wisu area,

and I really like the atmosphere, so

I just want to come out.

[Music] I'm in

prison.

That's why I

have to tour the warrior's house.



I come

to Pocheon and go to the

house of the warrior.  Hey

















you,

stop broadcasting, man, why are you so

smart and have good ideas? Come on,



split this ramen and make up for it like cookies. It's because it's













Pocheon.  Hey ah,

I'm hungry, I have to

do this, I have to



do this, I became a Korean at 45 and I have to do this

[Music]

No, I

never do it.





Why

don't I do it on my birthday?



Party party, this is why I



have to do something I wanted to do when I was young. It



seems like granting











death row inmate's last wish.  Did you



leave it







there because you













ate it



?



[Music] It's











like a sailboat [

Music] [

Laughter] [

Laughter] [

Music] That I

'm a member of society  Actually

[Music] The

launch party menu is something we all

like

Oh, I got















this.  You've been

brought here.



















How much is there? There are several levels from 1 to

100. You

can adjust it so finely.  I





















made mara xiangguo for the first time Oh, that

hyung did better the first time he did it



[Music]

Fantastic wok

wow

[Music]

The smell

and this is the smell of this warehouse

msg

[Music] It's

always there, so it's over



Fast food.

If



I do this, I'll do it



35 times,

stop blowing the pepper, it's

delicious

[Music]

No, I

think the Chinese people will be surprised. Now that I



have this, it's like the Japanese are

eating nuclear hot chicken stir-fried noodles.  Like

[Music] It's

a bit like going in again I



wonder if the drug detection dog smells it and comes back I know what the deep artist said I

remember my family's

making it with the feeling that they don't make it I already

have that feeling There's no tomorrow Can I contain this feeling

[Music]

No  It

's very inconvenient. Then you

have to wear a suit when you go to a party.





















It's too heterogeneous.

Heterogeneous

can mean something exotic.

This is a meeting of a certain kind of emotion. It's Silk

Road. It's become a real cartoon

apartment.











Even if you put in , you should still feel like a party,

but it looks like a plate after the party. You talk























too much. The party is over

after all the guests have left.  [









Music] Don't tell me it's over [Music]

What's over now

[Laugh] [Music]



How many times have you said "unlucky" [Music]



Don't say you're going in

[Music]

Kimchi is missing at the party  I can't do it.

Korea, China and Japan are all gathered. I













really wish for prosperity and peace in East Asia.

And I love myself



so much.



But

I think mackerel will like it more.

What does that mean? You like that seawater.



















Can I make it?

[Laughs]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music] I

think it's because it's a little too salty. It's

not like that. This is also rice.

















[Music]

Mara

What does wangcho mean?

Isn't wangchomyeon something good? It's the king,

so it's

coffee

coffee.

Coffee was

heavy.

It was really heavy.









[Music] I

think you're Mr. Ghost,

so I don't think this is real right now.













Wrong Then,

I want to interpret the store in Pocheon-si like this. I want to



erase time by including this interpretation.













[Music]

Decorate

[Music]

Oh really oh thank you Hey

This is what Angus Ward's

ambassador will be  Are you















done then, let's go back here after



embroidery

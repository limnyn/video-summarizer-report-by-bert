There were two things that humanity really wanted to go through. Even if it was newly discovered, it was cigarettes, drugs, and things like that. Unfortunately, the end of the Americas, which they thought would exist, was much further south than expected. It was a dangerous sea, like a great archipelago where a storm blows from time to time. And finally, they landed in the Philippines, and successfully sailed to Asia only to the west. If you go 82km through the land of this region, you don't have to pass the jungle between the Pacific Ocean and the hellish sea, Acapulco and Veracruz. The Panama Canal was a part of the Pacific Ocean, literally a sea-sunk mountain range, and the fact that it penetrates the canal here means that it penetrates the mountain. And he forced Colombia, the owner of the Panama Land, to force a treaty. It was a condition that the United States would lend the land on both sides of the 16km canal for 99 years, 10 miles wide, centered on the canal. However, Colombia was just a meal to the United States, which had already pacified North America and revealed the true colors of the Japanese invasion. The Colombian army came to stop independence, but they couldn't even land on their own land and ran away. The United States continued the construction that France had been doing for the first year. After the cultural revolution, the distance from New York to San Francisco has decreased from 22,500km to 9,500km, half of which was less. The United States Navy can freely travel between the Pacific and the Atlantic, which has a great influence on the improvement of the World War I and II. Just think that there was no Panama Canal when Jinju was attacked by Japan. However, this invasion made it a bigger excuse for South American anti-American nationalist forces, and the U.N. adopted an official resolution to criticize the U.S. and so on. Panama is the country of the canal, for the canal, by the canal.

Taehyun Oh Nice to meet you The mic will come out right now I forgot to turn it off I did it all of a sudden, and personally, I like it better. It's sad because I'm going to work instead of starting school. In 15 minutes, I feel like I need to warm up a little bit, so I opened it a little earlier. The realization of three jobs is no one else's business for me. You 'll think that the limit is more thrilling and success is a great success because the number of investments is different. That's why I talked about the military the other day when I was calm. You suddenly asked that good question, but once a good question comes up, it's just that I'm comfortable with it and it's very thrilling. If you look at it, you can't compete with Zhuge Liang and the CSAT, and if in the past, you couldn't call it empirical evil, and the old mediocrity was called positive history, but those pathetic scholars wouldn't even say a word without a record. Then, anyway, the Han Dynasty is written with a focus on the breast. We don't know anything about Goliath, even those who don't go to church know he's Goliath. So, it's hard to know because war only unfolds one aspect out of many aspects. But sometimes, this goes wrong, and Zhuge Liang is overrated. When this happens, it connects to the main body and the camera doesn't seem to be disconnected, but if you look closely, people don't know what it means to be an administrator, and can administrators be ignored like that? Now, if you look at fraud, the most representative administrative department in Chinese history, or, as I said earlier, a person who feels like a governor digests it because if you look at what needs to be digested, he was originally from the same hometown as Liu Bang and was a local Hyeonhae official. Even when we go, we talk like this because of this, as if we ruled later. I can use those things well because I can now do things well without causing problems, and I can use those things well. We see what we commonly call administrative ability and management ability very differently. I'm a bit sorry when I tried to use the image from the drama while saying let's not speak the image from the drama, but it's not like the quarantine manager from the drama. Then, those who know who Hercules is, know what that word means. For example, when you say that he is the chairman of the Samsung Group, we know that the Samsung Group has dozens of companies and there are 50,000 of them. If you didn’t have digestion, I wouldn’t say that you all starved to death. If I were to say that the person who set the goal for you to fight was Sohwa, I did all the strategic planning. It's easy for the field commander to say, "Who should ambush?" So in that series, mainly the battle that day is now that the US Army is in an ambush next to the heavy-duty army in the past. However, this Yeonju was completely surrounded by the main characters of the Three Kingdoms at the time. In the abandoned 6 vs 1 7 vs 1 situation, Cao Cao was in a situation where everyone attacked. It plays the same role, then it even gave all the operational orders that Guan Yu's equipment had to do, and what we know later, after Liu Bi's death, it was administered and all of these things were done. As we often think, there's a plan for a novel and something like that. Being good at a strategy and being determined to cut it off are different. It's more challenging in a way than the CSAT, and I think he wanted to do more. Anyway, because Zhuge Liang lacks data and the situation at the time was so urgent that the country of Chok was in a hurry, so I do n't know about historical things like this. It is a judgment of the situation and a strategic decision or a presentation of a strategy. Among the people called Mosa, there are various factors such as the manager, the president, the prime minister, and the minister, as mentioned earlier. It's coming out, everyone, it's not cut off right now, if you have a question, you get a question, and it's late at night, but it's longer than I thought, and the main topic ends like a ghost, so the stable server YouTube seems to hate me. There is something wrong with the image, but when you look at the statue of Guan Yu, it is not the same. Because it was that ferocious style, one of the images was so different. Guan Yu as emperor I don't remember who is appearing as Guan Yu as emperor. Does it mean the ability to choose things quickly and give up what to give up because of that? Of course, Zhuge Liang also presented policies with cruel conclusions. That's why life is long if it's long and short if it's short. During that life, in some way, similar decisions are repeated countless times, and there are special moments. Just get over it, don't get over it if you can't get over it  It's true that the great general of the Wei Dynasty is Mac, but please do the Qing Dynasty. Was it customary in East Asia for victorious countries to obliterate all records after defeat? As for the story of Manchun, it's so outlandish that I can't actually confirm it. I'm curious about the book that the doctor picks the best among the books that go to school. I don't write when I go there, but I feel like writing poetry. Even if it seems like a quiet village in the countryside, things are a little different for foreigners. I went there just like this, so I had a really hard time that day, and when I went to the Kannai Battlefield, the road was not connected. That's why I said it out of concern, so I hope you don't take it too seriously.

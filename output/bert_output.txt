Let's go to season 4 mummy with the feeling of sharing the legacy. Aren't you glad Sappsaladis What are you talking about  It's sealed this time Ah, what, I sealed it for a second. If I wore leather today, it would be a big deal, but it's leather and it's a clone. I saw this on subway line 1, at the back  It's not a regular menu, auntie, there are three corporals and a lot of sick people  There is this person. Even if a soldier like this greets the fashion industry like this   You're good at it, Pocheon Jidida. Corrosion  That's a very dangerous disease  What, what, uh, the machine comes out  Hey, you couldn't stand it after season 2. Being extremely salty is the same as being extremely sympathetic.

Of course you can't do that, if you 're like Watson, you'll laugh when you see such things. In principle, the Department of Architecture is a 5-year system. In the case of Yonsei University, there was only architectural engineering when I was in school. In order to be able to design the curriculum more freely after coming out of the College of Engineering, the person who said now has a Department of Architecture that belongs to the future. From an architectural point of view, it's a pity to destroy it. A lot of modern heritage will be lost, and in a way, we will lose a lot of cultural assets that Seoul has. They allowed them to build something 20 stories higher than the current building. It's not that it's getting thicker, it's getting thicker little by little. So, what that means is that the force that I have to endure per unit area must be much harder going downwards. As far as I remember, when these people look at nature, living creatures keep dying and being born again, dying and being born again. I build another building and then use it for 20 years and destroy it again. Even when it is transferred as it is, when it encounters similar conditions, it is less likely to twist or deform with this purpose. Anyway, if it's made naturally, it's right to bring it up and down and use it on the road, and it's structurally safe and fits the zero characteristics. Like architecture, the method we used is to put one layer of prescription on the roof. It's okay, because it's a program that ruins books if you come in a lot, so when you look at it in terms of proportion, you made the roof and the elevation part one-to-one, so it's similar. I'd like to tell you that, then everyone, if you're like Watson, you should be able to laugh at such a thing.

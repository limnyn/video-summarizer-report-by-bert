I think the space called the bathroom is, in a way, a primitive space where I can find myself. I think the level of the natural scenery is a bit different, and because the natural scenery is so good, I also build a study that goes well with nature. I'm a lustful person, so I ca n't pay for things like cell phones and go in. It's called the Arambra Palace for what we used water very well. Of course, there are all of them, but the interesting thing here is that when you enter the cold bath, you light a fire under the silver, which is slightly blue or so it is visually different, and the shower space is also about 1 to 4 meters high, and there is a shower device that falls like a waterfall from the top, next to it  There are places where the mask falls like rain with several thin water streams, so you can experience various things. But in this special swimming pool area  There is such a Turner Diana that I can enter a lot only if I completely soak myself in the water and put out a dog. It is also connected to other spaces in the hotel, and yes, it is just made of a three-dimensional space like a maze. So, actually, there are only about 3 types, but the lengths are slightly different. Because this building is so large, too many large box walls are exposed, and it is a natural landscape around it. The reason is that you don't have to use a lot of windows to make this gap invisible. That's why creating a dark space was a very important first step in this Bals Spa.

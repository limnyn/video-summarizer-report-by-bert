It’s all wrong, Mr.
Hyunkyung Lee Nice to meet you Younghyun Nam Jaebin Song Sat Mr.
Park Jonghwa Mr.
Yerin Baek Mr.
Baek Yerin Mr.
Baek Yerin Mr.
Kwon Taekmin Mr.
Taehyun Oh Nice to meet you The mic will come out right now I forgot to turn it off I did it all of a sudden, and personally, I like it better.
I'm sorry, but this is my routine.
In July, meerkat, keynes, hoyeon, nice to meet you.
Everyone in the world knows that it's family, but it's uncomfortable that it's true that you do it at 8 o'clock on the seventh, then you'll break your daily routine, and from that time until the night, you're writing.
Oh yeah, but it's a good time to worry about the start of the semester.
There's a vacation.
That's right  If I do n't hang out with the nocturnal kids, people around me will turn into subjective people.
It's sad because I'm going to work instead of starting school.
People just came out, but I don't even want to take one.
So, how did I go in because I was so hungry, and next to me was a young office worker and a slightly older company, and I was talking like this.
A young person was just talking.
Hey, hey, it seems like yesterday when I was talking about something like that, and I just heard it.
I just want to open it because I want to do it, but when I actually do it, I don't have enough time to live.
To do it, I suddenly had that thought.
It seems like it, but when it passes by, it seems like the time to do it is not enough even for 100 years of life.
So it's a good time to go to work.
It's very uncomfortable to say, no, do office workers only work for others ?
I’m also someone else’s business.
Doing my own work, so even if it’s a company job, it’s not everyone else’s business.
It’s because I can’t distinguish between my own work and other people’s.
I think it was, but it's a holiday, but that holiday is a holiday until 12:00 am.
My friend is having a hard time.
Everyone has their own taste.
Well, I have a hard time doing what others like.
It's really hard for me when I go to a concert.
In 15 minutes, I feel like I need to warm up a little bit, so I opened it a little earlier.
The realization of three jobs is no one else's business for me.
Life is endlessly invested when it blows up so much.
I'm still investing, but that's why I'm a real business person by investing.
You don't have to invest 100 and eat all the fruits to succeed.
That's what I think at times like this.
Investing 10 things and getting one thing, investing 100 things and throwing a limit, and of course investing 10 things and spreading one thing is efficient and successful.
You 'll think that the limit is more thrilling and success is a great success because the number of investments is different.
That's why I talked about the military the other day when I was calm.
Some people think I just played and ate there.
I won't say anything else, but at that time, whether it was administration or whatever, those things helped me in the end.
I got fruit.
Is it related to okrajang?
The level is high.
You suddenly asked that good question, but once a good question comes up, it's just that I'm comfortable with it and it's very thrilling.
I put that title on it.
Well, it's the main topic, so I'll talk about it later.
If you look at Sohwa now, you can talk about the Prime Minister or the Prime Minister.
If you look at the amount that has been done, ink and Zhuge Liang are no match.
That's not to say that Zhuge Liang is no match for the SAT.
If you look at it, you can't compete with Zhuge Liang and the CSAT, and if in the past, you couldn't call it empirical evil, and the old mediocrity was called positive history, but those pathetic scholars wouldn't even say a word without a record.
In terms of standards, there is no record of Zhuge Liang, so we can't talk about the Zhuge Liang we know now.
That's why the proportion of pure black is high.
Not only the mysterious future, but as you said, inferior studies are abolished by Xiang Yu.
Then, anyway, the Han Dynasty is written with a focus on the breast.
We don't know anything about Goliath, even those who don't go to church know he's Goliath.
Wow, that's amazing, but Goliath didn't do anything.
Wasn’t that completely absurd?
Well, you can even think of things like this.
So, in a way, Hangwoo was explained like Goliath.
I wrote a poem well before, and it was a reverse divergence machine, so sometimes people do it, just believe it and come to it.
You can't tell what kind of person Xiang Yu is by using verse 19.
So, Xiang Yu is like a Goliath.
In other words, Xiang Yu is not as detailed as Jojo, Liu Bei, or Liu Bang, but like Goliath, he was inflated to make his breasts float.
It's been reported, so it's really hard to find out about the Anti-Wuhoe ability and the problem.
They fought, of course, that's true, but the 10 people who said that they could solve the war with it, if there was a gang fight in the neighborhood, what would the Jongno group and the Myeongdong group do?
You can say that, but war doesn't just have that.
So, it's hard to know because war only unfolds one aspect out of many aspects.
That's right, even in Marvel movies these days, villains just appear like villains.
It 's hard to know because Xiang Yu is written in such a role.
Now, today's story already has questions like this, so I'm going to proceed with today's talk.
I won't be able to do it all in a few hours today, but the thing I caught today is that the Three Kingdoms has been a little busy in the meantime, and I've been touring overseas again, so I haven't been able to film for over a month.
There were a lot of them, so I wanted to be informed of all of them, so I wanted to prepare, and the gap was too long, so I filmed this and edited it.
It comes out in another week or two.
I'm going to shoot tomorrow with Heo Jun, but it might be better if I do it with Heo Jun, but I picked up this topic anyway.
Or is it embroidered and who is the smartest Zhuge Liang ?
Now, the story comes out, and then, from a political perspective, there are questions such as who is better than Zhuge Liang, and then, these days, there is a lot of knowledge about this and that.
It's hard to even say, it's really hard.
Many people now know that the conspiracy in the novel does not mean that Zhuge Liang in the novel is a military leader.
But sometimes, this goes wrong, and Zhuge Liang is overrated.
Well, with words that are not overrated, words that replace the opposite, Zhuge Liang goes like this in every administration.
The strange thing about language is that Zhuge Liang in romance novels.
Why are you like this today?
If that's not the case, then Zhuge Liang is an administrator, then people are just administrators, and so on.
But the problem here is what an administrator is.
The server stopped abnormally.
When this happens, it connects to the main body and the camera doesn't seem to be disconnected, but if you look closely, people don't know what it means to be an administrator, and can administrators be ignored like that?
You can just think of the copywriters in "The Prime Minister," there's a minister, and if it's under the glove or if it's a company, it's much more convenient to understand it in a direct way like the president, president, executive director, and manager.
Wait, the internet here is unstable, then I'll fix it for a second.
The camera quality is good, but it's a pity.
When I use it, the picture quality is good, but there was no problem with this before, but the Wi-Fi is a bit bad in my house right now.
For various reasons, I ca n't change the camera.
Eh, then next time I'll move some Wi-Fi machines and my house is in a bit of a bad state so I need to fix it.
Then the quality is a bit low, but it's a waste, but I 'll do it again.
So what does it mean to be an administrator?
I think so, so now I'm going to talk about Sohwa once, and we know in general, it's been said before, but well, isn't it the prime minister or not happy?
Now, if you look at fraud, the most representative administrative department in Chinese history, or, as I said earlier, a person who feels like a governor digests it because if you look at what needs to be digested, he was originally from the same hometown as Liu Bang and was a local Hyeonhae official.
I knew it, and he was a very smart and competent official.
And Hamyang's breasts are now on the same side, and when he entered Hamyang, the antigen was set on fire, but this man actually brought his entire family and had a team of his subordinates.
I didn't go in alone, I took quite a few of these people, and I think I procured a lot of various administrative officials from under the breast.
Even when we go, we talk like this because of this, as if we ruled later.
So, now we think of Sohwa as the representative administrative bureaucrat, and we think that the supply is also the best.
Is Sohwa right?
Sohwa  What does Sohwa do?
He's good at organizing books, he's good at managing his organization, he's good at distributing it as a personnel manager, he's a genius in administration.
I'm very familiar with this kind of administration, so I think of a person who finds regulations, organizes documents well, stamps, and is a manager of organization management as a happy supply officer.
Are you a person who is good at arranging, procuring people, and sending them?
It's not at all at the desk.
The problem starts right here.
I'm talking about Zhuge Liang for the CSAT today.
Good management and organizational management administration Taking care of the administrative documents we are talking about now can be like that when you are an official in the county in Pyeyeon, which was the hometown of Liu Bang in that abandoned county.
I can use those things well because I can now do things well without causing problems, and I can use those things well.
I mean planning ability.
This is different.
We see what we commonly call administrative ability and management ability very differently.
When I was young, when I was living on an old moon, my digestion helped me a lot.
What did you say to the breast?
A bully or a person named Sohwa was very close to Yoobang.
If he said something like that to Bangbang, he was very close or he kept looking at me like this.
Not knowing how to accomplish things does n't mean that you're a weird, wrong guy, but that the person who first acknowledged the ability of breasts is Sohwa.
The role of the head of planning and the role of the head of planning are slightly different, but it is best to understand it as meaning that you are the president and I am the person to head the planning office.
And this role of the planning director is good at administration.
I'm a bit sorry when I tried to use the image from the drama while saying let's not speak the image from the drama, but it's not like the quarantine manager from the drama.
This makes me a bit of a headache Look at a lot of national and national issues I don't think it's a camera problem so I'll just try it  Because it's not there, it's hot like in summer, but anyway, it's hot or it's winter, so now I just come into the office, and when we were poor, even if there was steam, the fire didn't come out.
Actually, but anyway, when you come in just right and see steam coming out, sometimes you look at me, your eyes almost become angry  He looks at me with cold eyes, so how pissed off are you?
So we fell apart on the battlefield.
Why is that guy sitting behind me and living comfortably?
Did you all die of starvation?
This is incidental, and the most important thing is that this person was a strategic planning officer, and that old records are not kind.
What am I really talking about?
I read it like that and I understand it that way, but the two people in the past have a different way of explaining it than what we think now.
When we say, that word is a symbol.
Suppose we use this word.
He is Hercules.
Then, those who know who Hercules is, know what that word means.
People who know that means I am a muscular idiot.
That's why I accept it this way.
I've seen it, but this discipline doesn't necessarily mean feeding rice.
You have all the armor and logistics in that word.
Then, you can make munitions, manage munitions factories, and, in the best word for raw materials, state management, procurement of provisions, so it's an expression.
 There's nothing pitiful about this analogy.
For example, when you say that he is the chairman of the Samsung Group, we know that the Samsung Group has dozens of companies and there are 50,000 of them.
If it's Samsung after a thousand years, then let's assume that only cell phones are known.
Then, it's Samsung's chairman.
This is such a car.
Like I said, breasts are indigestion.
If you didn’t have digestion, I wouldn’t say that you all starved to death.
If I were to say that the person who set the goal for you to fight was Sohwa, I did all the strategic planning.
He also procured military supplies during the Great War of Guando, and he was good at such things.
However, there is one thing we miss even in the role of pure black.
Where am I going to attack?
What should I do?
There are things like forming an ambush and saying something like that, something like that, but Sunok doesn't even talk about a little strategist.
Then why did I say that last time?
You said that when you went out, no, what kind of guard, equipment, what, Howder doesn't have a brain?
Because I was just using basic laws like this, my body was Guan-Wu equipment, so I was really good at Guan-Wu equipment and I couldn't buy anything, so I even planned the operation as if Zhuge Liang was making it.
It's easy for the field commander to say, "Who should ambush?"  On the same day, I went around all the time with General Bang and Taegijang.
There's one more thing I haven't done in the oil field yet.
So in that series, mainly the battle that day is now that the US Army is in an ambush next to the heavy-duty army in the past.
It's all about battle.
I've been all the way along that line, so I went to about 5 to 10 ambush points, not up to 10 that day.
In the absence of Zhuge Liang, go to Mt.
Seorak to ambush.
Where will the ambush be set up?
Even the strategy was not like Zhuge Liang, but that's not the case.
What Sunok or Zhuge Liang needs is a strategic function.
In management, I said earlier that the ability to digest food by doing the amount is absolutely not to touch the ledger.
Then, how about the military association?
In the north, Jojo became a performer and occupied Yeonju.
However, this Yeonju was completely surrounded by the main characters of the Three Kingdoms at the time.
In the abandoned 6 vs 1 7 vs 1 situation, Cao Cao was in a situation where everyone attacked.
Then, in 194, they invaded Xuzhou again, but at this time, the massacre that had been reported was working against Jojo politically.
A person named Jin- guk appears in Jang-mak, who was a friend of ' Jung-mak', and he sees Yeon-jo and tries to swallow him.
So, in the absence of Jojo, who had gone out for Seojo's second attack, the entire Yeonjo fell to the tent leaving only three strings.
It's about 1 loss and it's a standoff.
Now, I barely escaped the crisis like this, but the situation got worse.
It's reduced to % or 15%.
If you think about it like this, it's awesome.
It's a 1 vs 7 vs 1 fight.
It's not a battle between the 30s and 50s.
In this situation, Jojo is now in desperate trouble.
So, which side to hit first is now the number of wins in a lifetime.
Because I saved you, I don't respect you like a master, but I don't serve you, but you're popular.
If that's the case, you still have your support base, so you don't have to be too scared.
Then where are you going to hit?
So it's hard to go there, so are you going to go to Jangmak or Jinjak?
Oh, they are there, and Yvon and Seonran, who were subordinate to Yeopo, are in the east, and Jinjae is in the east, and Jinjae and Sanran are in the west.
So, first, you have to strike Jin-gung, take Ah No.
2 and Seon-ran, and keep Jin-gung in check.
Even if you fight to the death and win militarily, you can't dominate because you've already touched your emotions.
I was going to go, but it doesn't matter if DK died.
Because I hate you so much, even if DK died, I won't stick with you.
In addition to organizational management and the Internship Administration, if you look at things like this, it's really hard to say that I'm the prime minister because of the value of president and vice chairman as a manager.
I don't know what the prime minister's role is.
I know, the Prime Minister will be very angry, but he is busy and has a lot of work and what part of his political role is.
I think this is a misunderstanding about administration.
Thank you for signing up for the mint condition.
So it's hard to say Prime Minister, and it's hard to say vice president.
It would be better to say that such a rule is the highest rank among the replicators, and it would be better to call it a rule.
It plays the same role, then it even gave all the operational orders that Guan Yu's equipment had to do, and what we know later, after Liu Bi's death, it was administered and all of these things were done.
It's a civil servant, right, so they say I didn't do the operational function, but that's not what I originally did, so who does it?
It wasn't enough.
He's saying that because he's very critical of the Northern Expedition.
As we often think, there's a plan for a novel and something like that.
No, then Zhuge Liang said that administration is good at handling administration, handling paperwork well, and disposing of it is not administrative, so when Liu Bi died, he said that he would become King Zhuge Liang again and if his son was competent, he would become your king and rule.
But in the end, Liu Bei or Zhuge Liang and any strategic management that governs the country have the same mission.
Then, what is the difference between cursing, disinfecting, and Zhuge Liang, Liu Bi ?
 This determination doesn't mean deciding one thing.
When people are pressed for time, under pressure, and have to judge countless people, even though they're good at analysis, there are people who hesitate to put it into practice.
So even if they make the same decision, it's different whether they do it a little faster, 10 minutes faster, or a week faster.
It's not that I can't make a decision, actually, the analysis is like this, but the decision is to cut off one arm.
Just as much, I have to cut it off.
I have to decide whether to cut off an arm or a leg, but I really can't do this.
Being good at a strategy and being determined to cut it off are different.
So, whether Sun-wook, So-hwa, or Zhuge Liang, they did n't try to be in charge.
Nothing ends well.
So, in my life, when I do something, it ends well, and I try to help each other and do it well as much as possible, but in reality, it doesn't work like that.
It's not that it has to be like that, but it was like that in the past.
It seems to be the same now, but anyway, especially in the past, in this part, the world was very cruel and very cold, so there is a difference in this part.
Then, what is the difference between Zhuge Liang and the CSAT?
When I look at it, it seems to be true.
Who is smarter or who is better?
It's more challenging in a way than the CSAT, and I think he wanted to do more.
It seems that he was an outgoing person, and Zhuge Liang had something challenging and exemplary, so he later did the military job, and he himself was like that.
No matter what they say, I think there was a desire to go out into the world and do both of those things at the same time, but there is no record at the top of what Zhuge Liang did, such as the SAT, where he posted something like this.
Objectively speaking, the part that I said was the ability to digest what I said was the ability of pure heuk is not well documented in the records.
I can say to the extent that I would have done something like this because there was a regional conflict and this was so.
For example, there was a certain situation at the time, such as the CSAT.
It seems that Zhuge Liang is regarded as an administrator because he is caught in two things, such as the Northern Expedition or the administrative ability that is obvious to the eye.
There can be no such thing.
Anyway, because Zhuge Liang lacks data and the situation at the time was so urgent that the country of Chok was in a hurry, so I do n't know about historical things like this.
However, I would like to decide that this is the ability or role of the SAT and Zhuge Liang.
So, to conclude the CSAT, what we commonly call an administrator is not like that.
It is a judgment of the situation and a strategic decision or a presentation of a strategy.
Zhuge Liang seems to be lacking in this part on record, but he probably handled it enough with that part.
So, he is just a simple administrator.
And let's not do that, and among the many imitations of the Three Kingdoms, in the end, as noblemen like Soon-wook and Zhuge Liang said before, well, if there is a prime minister minister, he is the one who played a role in the upper echelon of the prime minister level.
Among the people called Mosa, there are various factors such as the manager, the president, the prime minister, and the minister, as mentioned earlier.
People are Soon-ok and Zhuge Liang, and Han Dynasty and sometimes So-hwa, but I hope we can accurately recognize those roles.
It's coming out, everyone, it's not cut off right now, if you have a question, you get a question, and it's late at night, but it's longer than I thought, and the main topic ends like a ghost, so the stable server YouTube seems to hate me.
Is that right?
That kind of story is, of course, just a folk legend.
The question suddenly comes up.
The best copyist in the Three Kingdoms is Gao.
There are scholars and professors among scholars, and there are too many job groups, but copying cannot be explained as a single job group.
And when it's the same minister, what's the organ?
You have to divide it up like this.
Where are you thinking of going on your next overseas trip?
I thought of Tirke, but I don't know what the situation is right now, so I'm thinking about going to Italy.
And in winter, when China opens, we'll go to Xi'an.
I want to do it once a year.
So if China doesn't open, well, since I went to the Kansai region this time, I'm thinking of going to Tokyo.
In the winter of middle school, I'm thinking about going to Italy once this summer.
Shall we equip it as a god?
There is something wrong with the image, but when you look at the statue of Guan Yu, it is not the same.
But there are some things that are not raised to the level of rulers, so they combine anal and martial arts.
But, this style is a little different, so I think Guan Yu continued to be admired.
I especially like kings and kings because of their loyalty, and I like civil servants Jang Hwan-hwan because they went all the way from the military guard to the end.
Because it was that ferocious style, one of the images was so different.
So it seems that later, even the emperor got a role, and that was the case.
At least I like the doorways, and the god of the merchants is all over the place.
The god of the soldier, the god of the emperor, the god of the merchant  A delicious lunch with my wife Tomorrow is the day I can't have lunch with my wife, so thank you anyway.
Manlyekje said that King Seonjo and Gwanun were equipment, but that's probably a story from a novel.
 Guan Yu as emperor I don't remember who is appearing as Guan Yu as emperor.
From then on, it was very popular.
Then, even now, he competed as an emperor, and deification is a bit of an ambiguous expression because originally, the genitals of ancestors were like Japanese shrines.
Confucianism in the Middle Ages of the Song Dynasty got rid of such things in Korea as Confucianism came in, and since there are no shrines left in Korea, that part of deification doesn't have to be done just like this if you formally promote it as a god.
Determination is more realistic than the best method.
Does it mean the ability to choose things quickly and give up what to give up because of that?
But in a way, that seems to be true.
Of course, Zhuge Liang also presented policies with cruel conclusions.
It's different to be cruel to that other person and to be cruel to one's close associates, but since it was an era in which cruel decisions were made in that part, people who couldn't do that would not have been able to do it, and I think that there would be a difference between that person's determination.
Well, the reason we read history books, read novels, and watch dramas is because we are in such agony.
But that's not an easy way to say it either, because most people excuse their actions rather than analyze themselves.
This is really human nature, so there 's no progress.
That's why life is long if it's long and short if it's short.
During that life, in some way, similar decisions are repeated countless times, and there are special moments.
I think it's the difference between how objectively a person who can't be can be himself, or whether he rationalizes himself by mobilizing all wisdom, knowledge, and YouTube and even this time he shares with me.
Is there a way to reduce self-justification ?
I'm sure I've seen cases like that before, but people around me say things like that.
It's hard to say those words to others.
I had a special misfortune in my childhood, so you might be able to do it, but I had a special experience and misfortune.
Should I call it the truth?
I think I can admit half of it.
Well, in some parts, it's harder than you because I've had a special experience.
I admit that part, but I can't admit it 100%.
I think that’s why I have to do it Even if I say that, I have to do it Even if I ca n’t get over the chin, I have to challenge even if I can’t get over it, even if it’s an excuse to say I won’t climb because the mountain in front of me is high, I don’t have the right to decide.
I see a lot of mountains that I can't climb, and there are people who can't climb even now, and there are people who easily climbed over such mountains for reasons we envy, or people who got over them because of how they hurt others by using tricks.
In that case, there are three very good reasons.
I don't think about it.
He goes over it so easily, and I'm a very difficult mountain.
I tried the same, but I just think like this.
Can't I put a mountain in?
Just get over it, don't get over it if you can't get over it  It's true that the great general of the Wei Dynasty is Mac, but please do the Qing Dynasty.
No matter what we do, we can't escape the limits of records.
For example, in the country of Chok, as we see now, there was the best master general, but his name and for some reason did not remain.
I can't do this because it's poor, so if Ijust follow the records of the Three Kingdoms, I have no choice but to go to Guan Yu's equipment.
I don't think he'll do it and he seems to have played a lot, but it's a bit of a waste.
So I think that maybe there was a more mysterious aspect that is a little closer to a novel than what we see at the top.
It's not, but the role is a bit ambiguous, but looking at it, I don't think it was an absolutely incompetent general or something like that without the ability to fight.
After that, if you look at the record of the patrol, even the lectures on Kang, Wang Pyeong, and Kang, who fall like that, may have to come out ahead of you.
I conquered 10 silver mountains.
The Himalia is also talking about our climbing.
Some people conquered two, but everyone said that the one who conquered two is more capable, but due to various misfortunes, I only managed to do two.
Then I can understand that, but is that person better than the person who conquered 10 things?
And it's hard to judge like this.
Well, I can't come up with a new interpretation like this.
Was it customary in East Asia for victorious countries to obliterate all records after defeat?
You can't call such a custom a convention, just someone was happy.
Well, there are cases where people's nature is just a country's system or whatever, because of various social structures, the records are a bit off, and there are cases where a tombstone was erected but you couldn't break it.
You said that Caesar and Alexan came out.
If there is a commercial base like that, there are a lot of records, so besides that, there are also political and structures.
And there is a difference because of these various differences.
And we keep saying that history is written by the victors, but in the old days at our church, there was an older sister than me.
It's not huge, especially women do a lot of mom and mom.
Likewise, it is always necessary to have the ability to understand in a given environment, but the record of the winner of history should be used for a limited purpose or for an accurate use.
Nim, I was like that when I was little, but there are people like this with my mom, dad, and grandma.
It's great.
Looking at the Vlog, you use an iPhone and a MacBook.
Are you sure it's an iPhone 15 ?
I'm thinking about it 4 days I don't particularly like the iPhone, because I use a MacBook for my computer, and the fact that I use a computer MacBook is for other reasons that you guys don't think of  at all.
I'm using an iPhone because it's easy to do.
As for the story of Manchun, it's so outlandish that I can't actually confirm it.
And at that time, there's a bit of a problem, so I can't say anything about it.
Thank you, so I'm thinking about changing it.
I don't know if I use my photo cell phone in less than a year and use it two more years later and compare Putin as a figure from the Three Kingdoms.
I've never met Putin.
However, there are people responsible in World War II, but the responsibility is ambiguous, and the individual's role in the war can never be left out.
When you always approach history, who is responsible for this?
Rather, how did someone decide and act in this situation?
I think it should be entered like this.
I'm not ignoring that, but I just want to talk about the history.
How many Three Kingdoms is your favorite?
It's a very good question.
Now I remember that video too, but it's been so long, I can't remember if it was 3 or not.
I can't say that it's changed, but I think it was really good if it was three-dimensionally changed, but my memory might be confused now, or maybe it's just 3 and 5 combined, so actually, the other day, I was doing something with Heo Jun.
I said how about reminiscing while playing something like Core's Game 35, but it's just that Mr.
Heo Jun and Dr., do you have time ?
Don't even talk about it, it's over But honestly, I'm a bit confused about 300,000,500, but I think it's right.
35 Both of them were perfect at that time.
I know a lot, it's just something I've seen while playing with you in places like this.
What do I know about buzzwords?
I don't know either.
"I have to joke about it, but I do n't like the expression of laughing at it, but the child said something like, 'Let's not talk nonsense among close friends.'
A fan of the Three Kingdoms did this, and well, Civilization Age of Discovery is the game I liked.
Do you have other publishing plans besides books?
I do, but it's a bit difficult for me to disclose them yet, and it's not because I really hate myself this much, but because of moral issues like that.
I think there are five of them.
There are one or two or three revivals of books I've written before, and I'm writing three new ones.
I do n't know if I'll write all of them this year.
I was rejected for three or four reasons.
I do n't think I'll have it  So I'm going to do it differently now and publish it next year.
I think there's too much to do, so it's a pity, but it's a pity that I'm not a Joseon cat.
No, my book sells as much as I thought.
I wrote the Goguryeo Sudang War or the Sui Dynasty War.
It's normal compared to the times, but it's normal that doesn't interfere with daily life.
So if you think about being old, it's normal.
War and history of war, not war history.
War and history.
I'm curious about the book that the doctor picks the best among the books that go to school.
I do n't know what "Bakga" laughed at Joseon, who castrated desire.
Did it sell a lot?
Ah, what is the criterion for whether it sold a lot?
I don't know what kind of book sells well, but just because people say it's a great book, how much it sells is a completely different issue.
I did it at the level, but it went a little higher than that.
It was a level that I would shoot once every few years.
It sold a lot.
I made a lot of money with this.
I'm asking if it can be said that a lot of stuff like that was sold.
It sold more than it didn't sell, but in June I believe that Turkey is collaborating and I'm raising money.
Should I go to Italy instead of Turkey?
You said it was difficult, but the answer was too serious.
That's right, it happened again.
Should I ask a question now?
I have to go filming genetic history.
Yes, I'm here in Sejong City, and I have to go to Seoul tomorrow.
And I gave you the New Warrior manuscript, but I think I need to read the manuscript again and prepare a little, so should I ask a light question?
Just 10 more minutes.
I'll close at 12.
How about Spain?
Spain says that Spain is good.
Listening to the people who went to spam, there's no one like Spain, so it's really good.
Spain has a high proportion of the natural environment, so I keep avoiding Spain.
I'm still a little late when I go.
What time is the Doctor happy?
Sejong’s Gangnam Clarke Chevalier is in Syria.
I don't write when I go there, but I feel like writing poetry.
How nice would it be to take a walk along the dockside?
He said he had been to a lot of movies and content, so he asked where he liked the best, and he said he liked Portugal so much, but that's the criteria he said.
I'm just like this So what did you like?
I can't express it in words Especially, this taste is very personal, so I can't say anything, but I like it, but I still  I like it too, but I'm losing my priority to go to .
Of course, it's Italy right now.
I've been working on a strategy to make them live in Italy for a month, but I don't think this year will work.
To a friend of mine who resigned saying, "I can't die while working," there was someone I knew in the past who was like that, and his life was very twisted between Ronaldo and Messi.
Who do you like, to be honest, I've never seen Ronaldo or Messi play soccer.
Photo I don't watch spam league soccer.
For example, I like soccer and sports, but I can't watch them all.
When I have time, I watch a little bit of British stuff, but I can't even watch it all the time, so I can't follow Ronaldo and other Messis around.
Morocco, Morocco, Spain.
There are a lot of people, but I do, but if I go, isn't it time to see the mafia in southern Italy?
I should say the atmosphere of the 1940s.
I went to a town like that and lived in a bed and breakfast rather than a hotel.
Everywhere I go, I get a sense of it, so I just came to Italy on my cell phone, and I said that it was a mafia building over there, and only the mafia in Italy wiped out the confiscated property and said it was confiscated property, so I'm using it as a library now.
But now what I want to say is that the location is really a town with library businesses lined up in one line, and it's in the middle of it.
But the fact is, there are a little more security issues in the countryside than the mafia, so when I was living for a month, I talked to someone who lived in Italy a little bit yesterday.
Even if it seems like a quiet village in the countryside, things are a little different for foreigners.
So, you can see it in the movie, and I go to the countryside over there.
That's why he said that, so for me too, it's a little different to just walk around and live for a month without any problems.
So you have to think about going to the countryside.
There are some things that make the moon live, unless it's a neighborhood you know specifically.
These days, there is a bachelor's degree in archeology or biology, but you can use it for archeology or history.
There will be enough space because one person with a different major and science major is history or something like that, because the prejudice is not as severe as when I did it.
I don't know if you're talking about it, but all the people who appeared in the Three Kingdoms have the same temperament.
Sunuk and Zhuge Liang are scary people even when they're quiet like in a drama.
I went around once for about a week, but the water is cheap, the scenery is good, and there are no ruins because it is built- in, but then I wanted to go to the battle site of Hannibal Cannai.
Traveling actually requires a lot of investment, so if you want to go somewhere like this, there is this, this, this, and this, and you have to go there for a while.
I went there just like this, so I had a really hard time that day, and when I went to the Kannai Battlefield, the road was not connected.
I've had a hard time, but the southern part is cheap, quiet, and nice, but people who have lived there or know it all say that their taste is a bit bad.
The problem is the same, the UK is the same, where is Lego?
This is a little different from trying to live.
This is what I heard the other day, and they said that it is better to pay more attention to such things.
 Leverland is in Korea.
I've been to Korea, so don't be intimidated again.
That's why I said it out of concern, so I hope you don't take it too seriously.
Yes, I'll stop here for today.
Thank you.

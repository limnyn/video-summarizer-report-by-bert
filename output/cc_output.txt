I think the space called the bathroom is, in a way, a primitive space where I can find myself.
Hello Watsons, this time, I 'm going to talk a little bit about Peter Jungteo, an architecture I really like.
The representative building is called Bal Spa.
It's a Swiss architect.
As you know, Switzerland is very good at making watches.
I think the level of the natural scenery is a bit different, and because the natural scenery is so good, I also build a study that goes well with nature.
Yes, there are so many great works in the 2-ft middle site, but if I had to pick the most representative of them, I would choose Ice Spa Bals.
It's in the area called Yes, I'm trying val.
That's the name of the town.
It's humid there, but I can't find the first mask.
But it's on a very steep slope.
I had to go, but I had to go there after a long, twisty meal.
There are many people who came by helicopter.
I heard that it is a place where a lot of rich people come.
It's just that there's a hotel and it's in a spa bathhouse, but the bathhouse was built too outfitted.
Everyone worries about what to do with the building in a place where nature is so beautiful.
In the case of a foot spa, a building is built half-embedded into the ground like this.
Isn't that a flat roof ?
The back of here is now eating breakfast, and the lobby is looking from here, looking from that direction, it feels like a grassy field in Switzerland, and it is connected to this hotel underground.
I'm a lustful person, so I ca n't pay for things like cell phones and go in.
I can't take pictures.
They show the pictures the photographers took like this.
Wow, things like a certain flow in space are very important, and this is really amazing here.
If you look at the concept of this building first, you have to make a building that seems to be buried in the ground and invisible.
Oh, I wrote two things to give that natural start-up.
One is on the other side of the entrance on this side.
Did you make an outdoor bath in an open space ?
, but if you go inside, it looks like it's a chewy space, but there are a few windows going out, and the biggest core idea of ​​this building is this slit.
See, light comes in here.
In fact, a beam has to go in to dedicate the ceiling to something.
Then the beam brings in the shadow.
A representative example is the buildings of Tadao Ando.
He told me to use the coordination know-how.
It came out of the slit again.
As the sunlight falls on it, it is supposed to illuminate the concrete, and if you look there, a black beam is connected in the middle because it has to cover the roof.
In fact, that's another cool thing.
Not plating Today's cool thing is that the angle of the shadow changes every time the position of the sun changes.
I wanted it to be connected as one.
That's why it has to be connected without turning it on and off.
What it means is that each of these boxes is made as an independent unit.
So these walls go up to the roof.
It means that it should fall just right.
Then these rooms should be there.
If you look at this floor plan, I will give you love.
It starts falling off, of course, because it's so small that you can't see it from the lobby.
It's the best one, but when you go in, you can experience everything about water and what it is.
It's called the Arambra Palace for what we used water very well.
is the best, so I was most interested in how to express water when I was building the palace.
That's why there are fountains and there are various sounds.
It is water.
The workers at the Aran Bura Palace said that the water is concentrated and this space is a place where you can experience water through hearing, sight, and touch.
Of course, there are all of them, but the interesting thing here is that when you enter the cold bath, you light a fire under the silver, which is slightly blue or so it is visually different, and the shower space is also about 1 to 4 meters high, and there is a shower device that falls like a waterfall from the top, next to it  There are places where the mask falls like rain with several thin water streams, so you can experience various things.
Personally, one of the best places for me is to swim.
There is the same place.
When we normally enter all spaces, I put my foot on the ground and put it on this kind of floor, and then at least 1.7 inches high, and the ties must be tidy to enter like this.
But in this special swimming pool area  There is such a Turner Diana that I can enter a lot only if I completely soak myself in the water and put out a dog.
It is also connected to other spaces in the hotel, and yes, it is just made of a three-dimensional space like a maze.
If it is clearly divided, in the case of Als Spa, on a double site, it is made of very smooth stones made by stacking stones one by one.
I don't usually feel like this, so I make a pattern of a few different sizes to make it look like a more common natural rock.
As you can see, I use a mix of these long and short ones.
There's a size, then a medium size.
I'm making these in a few different combinations.
So, actually, there are only about 3 types, but the lengths are slightly different.
So, at first glance, it feels like it is just a stratum created by nature.
First, I think I wanted to add more of the scenery of Switzerland.
Because this building is so large, too many large box walls are exposed, and it is a natural landscape around it.
I think I thought it would be possible, but the slope is very urgent anyway.
There is a slope on the day, and either make an embankment and build a building here, or bury the slope halfway and do one of the two.
This architect chose the latter.
The reason is that you don't have to use a lot of windows to make this gap invisible.
That 's why you don't need to use a lot of windows.
When I look at it, I think it is such a very primitive space where I can look at myself.
And what I say in the water means that even when life is born, we have amniotic fluid, and our eyes are always the source of life, so we go into the most essential space and immerse ourselves in it.
I think it is a space where you can meditate more than anything else.
There is no need for a lot of sunlight coming in through the slit.
The quality is much more important than the fine quantity.
Since the space is created, the effect is very good even if the light is small, and one is that there are not so many visual stimuli, so you can focus on the tactile sense.
I think I control my five senses like that.
That's why creating a dark space was a very important first step in this Bals Spa.
So, digging the ground and putting it inside is a good strategy.
I think you can see it like this.
To say that there is means that you can run all buildings.
Because in houses, all architecture is stem cells.
In houses, we usually live in two or three, four rooms.
It becomes a hotel.
The memory of the size of the kitchen becomes a restaurant, so all architecture started from a house where the owner is a cell.
How did you grow up to be so sensitive about a spa like this, really worrying about the properties of water, about the properties of light, and about the properties of the stone that makes this building, and through these things, it's a pity to create a really high-quality, essential space.
It's an architect of a level that's hard to do.
Well, it seems like everyone doesn't have to go, and I'm telling you, but maybe you have something to go nearby.
The biggest reason for filming is that you can experience it even if you don't have to go.
And in many ways, so you can think about what to do when I'm not good at making it, and how to create a space that I think is an indirect experience of everything from birth to death.
How do you write it so that you can experience it yourself?
The important thing is not to travel.
The public buildings there are not very good and there is no curry.
is really my favorite 0 water in Korea, but it's not open to the public.
It's a bit disappointing.
If not, everything is accessible.
I think you can look at it this way.
Many great works in our country are also houses, so we can't see them, so 00 buildings need to get better.
Our country's system is too poor for that, so good architects can't compete in the 00 Architects competition because the system is poor.
Of the great buildings in the world, I have ranked them among the bad ones, but there is almost no public project in the tattoo lane.
There is one Son Goku, and the rest are all released to the private sector.
Here's someone 4 Let's finish this.
See you next time.

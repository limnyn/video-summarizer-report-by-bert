There were two things that mankind really wanted to penetrate.
The water area of ​​the 9th continent and the Panama area of ​​the new continent were built b.
It was blocking the West and the Pacific Ocean.
After Columbus discovered the New World and Vasco da Gama pioneered the Cape of Good Hope route, Spain and Portugal opened an era of cultivation.
I'm asking for mediation, so I'm here to hear it like this.
From here, the west is Spanish, the east is Portuguese.
Reason Jura avoids each other's collisions.
However, spices and all kinds of valuable trade parts were pouring out from Africa and Asia beyond, while there was nothing in the New World.
Native Americans were not immune to the diseases of the 9 continents, so they were very vulnerable to contagious diseases and could not sail with good luck.
 And so, at the order of Charles V, the fleet led by Magellan set off on a voyage aimed at circumnavigating the world.
Unfortunately, the Americas they thought would exist, but the end was farther south than expected.
It was a dangerous sea at the level of a great aircraft carrier where there was no Antarctic circle where Yubin floated, and storms could see all the time.
But Magellan and the expedition team formed two ships  However, the Pacific Ocean was the world's largest river, much wider than the West, and in Mara, the first time they went there, they just crossed it by heading on bare ground without a stopover.
And in the end  After the landing in the Philippines, it was successful in going to Asia by sailing only to the west.
Passing through the territory of Portugal in the west as a concubine, I was able to compare it to Spain in just three years.
y It's not his thing to do.
España received a ward from Manila in the Philippines and built a port city called Fulco on the Pacific coast.
And by connecting Acapulco and Sea Cruises on the Atlantic coast by land, they were able to trade with China.
And at this time  Since Panama, there has been no need for a canal.
If only 82 km of the land in this area was penetrated, it would be hell in the Antarctic Ocean, but there was no need to know the jungle between Acapulco and Veracruz.
Drilling a canal was impossible.
Panama's job is part of the circum-Pacific orogeny belt, which is literally a mountain range submerged in the sea, and there's no saying that drilling a canal here means drilling a mountain.
In the 19th century, when the American colonies were becoming independent one by one, it was slowly becoming a realistic story.
France succeeded in opening the Suez Canal in 1869.
Ferdinand de Les Sex of France, who opened the Suez Canal with permission from behind this house, in 1880  Using that experience in 2018, he will challenge the construction of the Panama Canal.
However, if Suez was just coffee, Panama was blooming.
First of all, as I said before, this was a mountain and a jungle.
Due to the activities of the weapons, the workers got malaria and yellow fever and got out of the pick.
In the end, when 4 Sex and France recorded 21,200 bass for 9 years, the props were ruined and resigned, and Les Sex, who was in charge, sat in debt and spent a miserable last year.
At this time, the French Impressionist painter worked hard at the tunnel construction site of the Panama Canal, but fortunately, he returned without a hitch.
Since it was a country that originated from British colonies on the eastern coast of North America in the first place, its influence was bound to be limited to both the eastern coast and the Basilica.
However, after the colony of Missiana from France, Texas  It is an obvious secret that the people swindled California and bought it from the Russian Empire to Alaska, massacring natives in the process.
By the end of the 19th century, representative 2c public relations such as Los Angeles and San Francisco would settle down, and the United States, which had succeeded in obtaining a monk for a short period of time and entered the Pacific Ocean, was hit by Hawaii's ward and graduated from Spain, which had already been picked out of teeth.
It emerged as a leader in the Pacific area, such as ripping off the whole of the Philippines and the Philippines.
That 's how it faced such a fate that it had to avoid Panama's impossibility.
In this case, it was always necessary to be able to commit naval power, but to do so, like Nagellan, he had to cross the equator and look around the sea of ​​death in the Antarctic Sea.
This was a different problem than trade.
In 2008, US President Roosevelt paid 40 million dollars to buy the Panama Canal business right from France and used it.
It was said that they would pay a lump sum of $10 million on the condition of a 29-year lease in the United States, and a series of 250,000 dollars in rent after the completion of the culture.
However, to the United States, which had already pacified North America and revealed its true colors, Mia alone was just rice.
5 The United States was already one of the top 10 countries standing shoulder to shoulder with Western European imperialist countries, and above all, more friendly than Western European countries.
The United States thinks of creating an independent country in Colombia that looks like a colony but not a colony by using the Panama separatists.
The Republic of Panama declared the independence of the Republic of Panama, and the US Navy was betting on ships off the coast of Panama.
In the case of recognizing the independence of the fledgling Republic of Panama, it was to create one in just 10 days.
They started construction in 1904.
 The Americans did exactly what France was doing for the first year, but then they realized why the French were holding on after 21,600 bass in two years.
It was just a mountain range.
It was impossible to penetrate the granite house.
While it was put there, malaria caused casualties, and if it wanted to go in to some extent, the allowances for nearby cars would be locked from flooding.
Let's do it in many ways Second, instead of making the mountain range flat, let's just raise the boat to the mountain.
That's how the US completely changes the 04 method along with quarantine work, making it a 2-fire lake for cars and installing 3-stage locks in both directions 6  After 10 years of construction, the United States will succeed in farming 6,000 units for 10 years.
After the opening of the canal, the distance from New York to San Francisco has been reduced by less than half, from 22,500 km to 9,500 km.
It also had a great influence on trade around the world, so that it has never stopped operating except for two times for over 100 years since its opening.
It also has a very big impact on the aspect of the war.
Imagine that there was no Panama Canal when a lot of pearls were boarded by Japan.
It was pierced, it was owned by the United States, and the surrounding land was American territory, so the profits from the canal are also the United States.
riots erupted on a much larger scale, and 28 protesters were killed in the process of suppressing the riots.
No matter how strong the United States was, international criticism was inevitable.
In the end, in 1979, the United States returned most of the area to Panama, except for Una itself.
However, in order to eliminate the dictator Manuel Nourier, he invaded Panama and even changed the regime.
However, this invasion rather made a bigger justification for the station with anti-American nationalism in South America, and the UN also made an official resolution.
Eventually, in 1999, the Panama Canal was officially returned to Panama, putting an end to the direct US home to the canal.
Panama, which has the Panama Canal, is still the world's most important trade  It is one of the bases of many companies, making it one of the richest countries in Central and South America.
Because the tax on merchant ships is very cheap, more than 8,000 ships are registered as Panama nationality, and Korean merchant ships are also  It is said that there are many cases where it is registered.
Because it is the only way to cross the Americas, the annual income earned through the Panama Canal is close to KRW 2 trillion, and in 2016, it was expanded and opened for the first time in 100 years.
They officially got rid of their own armed forces in 1998.
There may be a number of reasons, but above all, it was possible because it was so clear that the moment anyone touched Panama, the United States would die.
You can say that the country is Panama.
We talked about the Panama Canal, which is the two largest mountain range and the most important strategic base of the United States because of the luck of the world.
So far, I've been the Kid of the Knowledge Pirates.
See you in the next video.
So, today, we'll start following a new bitter pill

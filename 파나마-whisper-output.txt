There were two things that humanity really wanted to go through. The Suez region of the old continent and the Panama region of the new continent. The commonality between the two regions was that they were in the way of the Atlantic Ocean. The Suez region was in the way of the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean, and the Panama region was in the way of the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. After Columbus discovered the new continent and Vasco da Gama pioneered the route of the Hopeful, Spain and Portugal opened the era of the Atlantic Ocean. Of course, the two countries had conflicts in the seas all over the world, and they asked the Pope for a mediation. Well, then, there's a line here. From here, the west is Spain's and the east is Portugal's. After deciding between themselves, they followed this rule in their own way, and the Americas, Spain, Africa and Asia, Portugal, advanced and avoided each other's conflicts. But in Africa and beyond, in Asia, all kinds of precious trade items, including perfume, poured out. On the other hand, there was nothing in the new continent. Even if it was newly discovered, it was cigarettes, drugs, and things like that. Also, the Americans did not have immunity to the disease of the old continent, so they were very vulnerable to infectious diseases and could not be used as slaves. Portugal's Asian perfume trade was so enviable that Spain thought that if it went further west beyond the Americas, it would be able to reach Asia, just like Portugal. The end of the Americas So, under the name of Carl Ose, the fleet led by Magellan began a voyage with the goal of traveling around the world. Like Africa, they thought that the Americas would end with this kind of intention. Unfortunately, the end of the Americas, which they thought would exist, was much further south than expected. It was a dangerous sea, like a great archipelago where a storm blows from time to time. However, Magellan and the expedition successfully passed through this hellish sea while losing two ships, and entered the Pacific Ocean. However, the Pacific Ocean was the largest ocean on Earth, much wider than the Atlantic Ocean, and they just crossed the coast without a middle landing on the sea. And finally, they landed in the Philippines, and successfully sailed to Asia only to the west. But the joy was short-lived. A conflict with the local people of the Philippines broke out, and Magellan, who was the commander, lost many of his crew and lost his ship, and he passed through the Portuguese territory in the west and returned to Spain in 3 years. It was the first world trip in the world, and it proved to the world that the earth is round, and it was a historic moment. However, Spain's conclusion was that it was not a matter of human effort. Spain received a wad in Manila, the Philippines, and built a port city called Acapulco on the Pacific coast. And they were able to trade with China by connecting Acapulco and Veracruz on the west coast. And from this point on, the necessity of civilization in the Panama region was reversed. If you go 82km through the land of this region, you don't have to pass the jungle between the Pacific Ocean and the hellish sea, Acapulco and Veracruz. But it was impossible to penetrate the Panama Canal with the technology of this era. The Panama Canal was a part of the Pacific Ocean, literally a sea-sunk mountain range, and the fact that it penetrates the canal here means that it penetrates the mountain. The Panama Canal, which was like a dream, was gradually becoming a realistic story in the 19th century when the American colonists of Spain were uniting one by one. In 1869, France succeeded in opening the Suez Canal. The French Ferdinand de Lesseps, who was granted permission from Egypt to open the Suez Canal, challenged the Panama Canal construction to revive the experience of 1880. But if Suez was just coffee, Panama was T.O.P. As I said before, this was a mountain, and it was a jungle. It was a level different from the desert-like Suez region. With the help of the human race and mosquitoes, the workers were caught in malaria and anti-inflammatory diseases and picked up. In the end, Lesseps and France died 21,900 deaths in 9 years, and Lesseps, who was responsible, sat in the rain and had a cold year. It's a side story, but at this time, French impressionist painter Paul Gauguin also worked hard at the construction site of the Panama Canal, but fortunately, he returned without much trouble. Even France, which had completed a much longer Suez Canal, supported it, so for a while there seemed to be no one challenging the Panama Canal. Until the US appeared. The United States was a country that started with British colonists on the east coast of North America, so its influence had to be limited to the east coast and the Atlantic. However, it is not a secret that France bought Louisiana colonists, Mexico took Texas and California, and bought Russia from Alaska and killed the natives in the process. All the obstacles to stopping the United States in the North American continent disappeared, and a huge gold mine was discovered in the west, accelerating the western reform, and by the end of the 19th century, representative western cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco would take their place. The United States, which succeeded in bulk-up for a short period of time and entered the Pacific, combined with Espana, which was already a toothless scoundrel, blocking the Hawaii ward, and tore the Guam and the Philippines apart as a whole, and was awarded the Pacific War. It was the beginning of such a fate that Panama should not have been through the canal. With the western reform completed, the United States was now a maritime power that encountered both oceans, and it should have been able to import naval forces to the Pacific or the Atlantic, but in order to do so, it had to go beyond the enemy island like Lazellan and return to the sea of ​​death in the South Pole. This was another problem with trade. Because the military ship could not be transported by land. Therefore, in 1902, President Roosevelt of the United States gave Panama $ 40 million and purchased the Panama Canal Business Ticket from France. And he forced Colombia, the owner of the Panama Land, to force a treaty. It was a condition that the United States would lend the land on both sides of the 16km canal for 99 years, 10 miles wide, centered on the canal. It was a temporary payment of $ 10 million, and after the completion of the canal, it was said that it would pay $ 250,000 a year in rent. It was a natural result that the Colombian Congress blew the whistle. In fact, it was a promise to give Panama money and make their own colonies. However, Colombia was just a meal to the United States, which had already pacified North America and revealed the true colors of the Japanese invasion. The United States was already a hotbed that was shoulder-to-shoulder with Western European imperialist countries, and above all, it was more cunning than Western European countries. The United States is planning to use Panamanian separatists in Colombia to create an independent country like a colony, not a colony, as if it were a colony. On November 2, 1903, the Panamanian independence forces, which were supported by the United States, rose to the occasion and declared independence in the Panamanian Republic on November 3, the next day. And the US Navy was waiting in front of Panama. The Colombian army came to stop independence, but they couldn't even land on their own land and ran away. Three days later, on November 6, the United States approved the independence of the new Panamanian Republic. It was only five days after the United States had created a country. The United States negotiated with the Panamanian government, which they had established, and signed a treaty to illegally lease 16km of land around the culture. The next year, 1904, the United States began construction. The United States continued the construction that France had been doing for the first year. However, France realized why it had been supporting the United States even after recording 21,600 deaths for 9 years. This was just a mountain range. It was impossible to penetrate the Hwagangam area of the Pacific coast. During the penetration, the number of people who were ill with malaria increased, and if it was possible to penetrate to some extent, the nearby Chagres River would flood and flood everything. In the end, the United States made two major decisions. First, let's get rid of all the mosquitos. Second, let's not make the mountain range a plain, but rather just raise the ship to the mountain. So the United States completely changed the construction method along with the quarantine work, built a dock on the Chagres River, and installed a triple-gate on both sides. After six years of reconstruction, the United States succeeded in construction with 6,000 deaths for 10 years. After the cultural revolution, the distance from New York to San Francisco has decreased from 22,500km to 9,500km, half of which was less. It has a great influence on trade around the world, and it has never been stopped except for two times over 100 years after the opening. The United States Navy can freely travel between the Pacific and the Atlantic, which has a great influence on the improvement of the World War I and II. Just think that there was no Panama Canal when Jinju was attacked by Japan. The United States could have lost. Yes, I'm sorry. Anyway, you can see how important the U.S. Navy is. The U.S. has penetrated and owned the U.S., and the surrounding land was U.S. territory, so the U.S. took all the income from the canal and drained the canal. In Panama, voices of opposition to the U.S. began to come out. There was the first bombing in 1959, and in 1964, a much larger bombing occurred. And in the process of suppressing the bombing, 28 protesters died. No matter how strong the U.S. was, it could not avoid criticism of international society. Despite the cold war, even liberal countries criticized it as a bit of a step beyond the line. In 1979, the U.S. returned most of the region except for the culture itself to Panama. However, the influence of the United States on Panama remained unchanged, and in 1989, Panama's dictator Manuel Noriega, who walked the anti-American route and held negative elections, even invaded Panama to remove him and change the regime. However, this invasion made it a bigger excuse for South American anti-American nationalist forces, and the U.N. adopted an official resolution to criticize the U.S. and so on. Eventually, in 1999, Panama officially returned the Panama Canal to Panama, and the U.S. direct control of the canal came to an end. Panama, which owns the Panama Canal, is still one of the most important trading points in the world. It is one of the middle-south American countries with many companies. Because the tax on the upper line is very cheap, there are more than 8,000 ships registered in Panama, and it is said that many Korean ships are registered in Panama. Since it is the only means to cross America, the annual income of Panama through the Panama Canal is about 2 trillion won in Korean won, and in 2016, it was expanded after 100 years. Panama officially removed its own army in 1994. There must be a reason for this, but above all, it was possible because it was so clear that it would be beaten to death by the U.S. the moment it touched Panama. Panama is the country of the canal, for the canal, by the canal. So, we talked about the Panama Canal, the most important strategic point of the U.S. and the world's canal world. The video about the history of the Egyptian Suez Canal is also uploaded, so it would be more interesting if you watch it together. This has been the knowledge pirate team. See you in the next video.
